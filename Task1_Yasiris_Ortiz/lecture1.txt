cat text.tx ? 

ls -al -> 

access system call: permissions for weather the file exits it takes
two arguments(file_path, execure_permission_to_check)
- 

errno: this is a global variable that can be access to now what is the eeror when making a system call 

code snippet: 

whatever code that is inseide the function will be execited, 
argc: means argument count
argv[]: argument that's being pass to the function 


commands to execute c files 

./a.out sample.text => this is how we pass the arguments, when we do this argv = ["a.out", "sample.text"]
if we don't pass any argument then argv =["a.out"].
You can pass more than one argument just by putting a space. the first argument will always be the generated file "a.out"


 : this is a binary file that is pass
 man is the manual command
 man 2 access
 man access: check accesibility of the file

 what is chmod?
 ls -al -> see the list of 

 SYSTEM CALL COMMANDS 


 read(fd, buffer, count) : works in a sequential manner 
    fd: 
    buffer: character edit and give certain sizes and pass it as a second argument ( buffer means intermediate)
    count: read and count the bytes/character from the file and then returns it
    123456789
    read(fd, buffer,5) => it will run up to five
    read(fd, buffer,5) => it will start at 6 because it runs sequencially
returns count 

write(fd, buffer, count):
    returns counts: 


Iseek(fd, offset, whence):
    offset: select the point that you wnat to start from
    whence: different positions start, directly to a point or just go to the end of the file, different flags for this paramenters are found at... 

close(fd):
    fd: make sure when we are done with the file make sure that we close it so we have free space.
    return code: if we get -1 it is because we have some error 

unlink(name):
    "This is use to the delete the named file


 flags : 
    O_RDONLY: read only when opening a file 
    O_WRONLY: write only format
    O_CREAT: if we pass this flag we don't have to use the creat command(whenever creating a file make sure that the right permissions are given to the file)
    (there is a list of modes that can be used)
    O_RDONLY| O_CREAT: creates a file and give the permission to read only
    vi [filename]: open a file to edit in read and write mode


gcc open_file.c -o open

./open sample.text

man 2 read 
man close
man 2 write

- : a minus means that it is a file 
rw:
r: read
x: execute
d: if it is a d in front it means is a directory

u - user
g - group
